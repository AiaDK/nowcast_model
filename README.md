### R Translation of Mixed-Frequency Factor Model for German GDP Nowcasting  
*Based on the original MATLAB implementation by Philipp Hauber (2022)*

---

## Overview

This repository provides an R-based implementation of a mixed-frequency factor model designed to nowcast and forecast German GDP growth using real-time macroeconomic data vintages.

The original MATLAB model was developed by **Philipp Hauber** as part of his doctoral work:  
**_“Essays in Bayesian Macroeconometrics and Forecasting,” Kiel University, 2022._**  
This R version aims to replicate the methodology and functionality while making the code more accessible to users in the R ecosystem.

> **Note:** This was my first major code translation project. While great care was taken to stay true to the original logic and functionality, the code may still benefit from further optimization.
